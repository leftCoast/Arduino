// Let's say you have a stack of playing cards. You want to deal them out but don't want
// to spend a ton of time at the end of the deck doing random numbers, trying to land on
// one you haven't delt yet. Heck, you don't even want to keep track of the ones you delt
// already. What to do? Here's your answer. The card index.
//
// How to use? Easy peasy! Lets say playing cards.
// 
// 1) You have 52 cards. Figure out a numbering for them 1..52. Meaning? I give you a
// number say.. 26. And you will be able to tell me what card that is. However you like
// to order them is up to you.
//
// 2) Create the cardIndex object with the number of cards you have. 
// For example : cardIndex myCards(52);
//
// 3) Deal cards from your deck. 
// For example : aCardNum = myCards.dealCard();
//
// 4) When the hand is over, just call loadList() to reshuffle the cards.
//
// 5) myCards.getNumRemain(); Will return the number of cards remaining tobe delt.
//
// That's all there is to it. 
//
// But it doesn't have to be playing cards. It could be custom game cards. It could be
// picking words from a list? Whatever list of things you need to be chosen one by one.
