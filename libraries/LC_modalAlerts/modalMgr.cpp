// constructor it calls this method to link itself into the modal manager's list. The
// modal manager creates a modalLink object to track this new modal. THEN the new modal
// gets a pointer the new modalLink object so it can unlink itself it someone deletes it.
//
// So..
//
// A) IF the modal completes normally. The list modalMgr picks up on this during idle and
//    deletes the modalLink object.
//
// B) The modalLink object, that we created here, then deletes the modal.
//
//    BUT..
//
// C) The modal may get deleted by something else. (Scary world out there.) WHEN it's
//    deleted, it NULLs out the modalLink Object's pointer to itself. Breaking the link
//    and casing its demise to be flagged.
//
// D) Hence : when the modalLink object deletes itself, it first checks to see if the link
//    to the modal is valid. If so, it will delete the modal. If not, it assumes someone
//    else did its job for it and goes on its merry way being deleted without re-deleting
//    the modal.
//
// The idea is that in this way, it doens't matter who deletes the modal. Both work fine.

// automatically be called in due time to link all the nonsense together.
