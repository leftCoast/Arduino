I'm starting to see people fork this repository. This may not work like you are hoping.

Maybe you see this as a neat toolset for programming Arduinos. It is, in a way. But really, its more like the huge pile of mess on my desk. Many things don't work, some are missing parts. Some will never work. There's probably spilled drinks and long dried out half eaten hamburgrs in here. This is just a swirling turmoil that new ideas spawn from.

So, if you see a bit you'd like, drop me a note and I'll make sure you get a copy that's not missing pieces or in the middle of a re-design.
