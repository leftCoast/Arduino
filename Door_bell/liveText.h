// Live text is text that can change over time in the background. This could be blinking?
// Or color changes or fade out. YOu pretty much have complete control over the line of text
// as one line. You don't have a char by char control here. Just color over time on a string.
// 
// You have your standard x,y,length, height paramiters. Then you have framerateMs.

// framerateMs : sets how long between changes it wait. This is not a perfect clock. 
// Things can effect it like the program doing something else somewhere else. But it 
// does the best it can and really all this is for is just looks & sizzle. So it should
// be fine.
//
// Loop : Tells us true - this should go on over and over forever. Or false - Do it once and stop.
//
// How long does the animation go on for? No parameter for that. Ah! This is the cool bit.
// The colorMultiMap sets this.
//
// addAColor() takes a time & color. Time is an integer representing milisoncds and color is a coloObj.
// You want your first color to start at time 0. Then you add them whatever color you want at wheatever time.
// It will sort them out in time order and blend over time from color to color.
// 
// For example : Show a string for 4 seconds then fade to black over 1 second.
// 
// addAColor(0,@white);
// addAColor(4000,@white);
// addAColor(5000,@black);
//
// That will do it.
//
// hold() and release() are for triggering starts and stops of animation. release() can reset the animation
// to the 0 frame for you if you'd like.
//
// NOTE : Best to use this over solid colors. Trying to animate on a .bmp bakckground is a flashy mess. Too slow.
